## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I plotted [weather data](cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I could navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where I can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.
